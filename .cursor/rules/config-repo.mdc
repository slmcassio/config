# VS Code / Cursor keybindings ordering

When editing `vscode/settings.json` or changing `vspacecode.bindings`, keep the which-key menu ordered as below (Spacemacs-style: mnemonic + discoverable).

## Top-level `vspacecode.bindings` order

Use this sequence for the root Space menu:

1. **Essentials**: ` ` (command palette), `/`, `?`, `Q`, `W`, `,`
2. **Context / navigation**: `c` (Cursor), `b` (Buffers), `f` (Find), `p` (Project), `e` (Explorer)
3. **Search & version control**: `s` (Search), `g` (Git)
4. **Code & tools**: `l` (LSP), `d` (Debug), `T` (Testing), `m` (Major), `x` (Code)
5. **Session / UI**: `t` (Terminal), `q` (Quit), `u` (UI), `v` (View), `w` (Window)

## Submenu order

In every submenu (and nested bindings), order entries by **mnemonics and frequency of use**, not strict alphabetic order.

General pattern:

- **Group commands by role** in this sequence:
  - **Navigate / open** (jump to or open things)
  - **Create** (new buffers/files/resources)
  - **Modify / act** (save, delete, rename, apply actions)
  - **Misc / maintenance** (less‑frequent or advanced tools)
- **Within each group**, you may sort alphabetically by `key` if there isn’t a clear frequency winner.
- Put entries with empty `key` (e.g. “No major mode”) **last**.

Concrete examples:

- **+Find (`SPC f`)** — navigation first, then search/refine:
  - Navigate/open: `f` (find files), `r` (open recent), `b` (list buffers), `o` (open file), `O` (open folder)
  - Search/refine: `w` (find in files), `s` (go to symbol in file), `S` (go to symbol in workspace)
- **+Buffers (`SPC b`)** — mirrors Spacemacs:
  - `b` (list buffers), `n`/`p` (next/previous), `d` (close), `o` (close others), `a` (close all), `r` (reopen)
- **+Git (`SPC g`)** — main workflow first:
  - `s` (stage), `S` (stage all), `u` (unstage), `U` (unstage all), then `c` (commit), `p` (push), `f` (fetch), `l` (pull), etc.

## Applying the order

- **Top-level**: reorder the `vspacecode.bindings` array to match the list above.
- **Submenus**: group each `bindings` array by role as above, then order within each group (empty key last).
